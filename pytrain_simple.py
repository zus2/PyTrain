#
# A simple Pybricks train motor controller - with a great controller handler 
# for extra precise playability. Easy to customise simple logic.
# Auto detects all hubs and up to 2 motors, DC or Technic
#
# Tested with Pybricks v3.6.1 (Pybricks Code v2.6.0)

"""
Instructions:
Change the motor directions below to suit your train
Motor detection automatic ( 1 or 2 in port A and/or B)
Use left +/- and left center to control the train
Red light = stop , amber = ready , green = go and cyan = crawl 
You can change the crawl speed below (DCMIN) and max (DCMAX)
Center red button once: stop the program and train instantly
Center red button hold 1 second: shut down the hub and controller
Run the program from your computer, or the hub (switch remote on promptly)
