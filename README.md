## Pybricks Train Controller script using asynchronous multitasking for smoother more lifelike inertia effects

### Features:

Asynchronous speed change and stop commands for inertia effect 
Customisable speed ramp crawl, max, min, accel and granularity (steps)
### Crawl speed calibration adjustable in programme 
### Synced indicator led for Crawl, Go, Stop, Ready, Calibrate 
### Added stop script or shutdown hub in programme using center button
### Support for 2 motors and initial support for sensor motors
### Heartbeat auto-shutdown and user input sanity checks
### Memorises crawl speed setting after shutdown
### Support for Technic and City hubs 
### Separate reverse speed limit which can be 0 for eg. trams

### To add: broadcast to second hub , headlights control

### Comments welcome, particularly the asynchronous logic and functionality. I am a new to Python, Pybricks and Multitasking !
