Pybricks Train Controller script using asynchronous control for smoother more lifelike inertia effects.

Strictly Beta software in inital stages of development - no warranty, use at your own risk.

Full documentation to follow, for now see in programme comments.

Comments welcome, particularly the asynchronous functionality - this is my first time using Python also .. ( I have a C/perl/php web history )
