Pybricks Train Controller script using asynchronous control for smoother more lifelike inertia effects.

Strictly Beta software in inital stages of development - no warranty, use at your own risk.

Full documentation to follow, for now see in programme comments.

Comments welcome, particularly the asynchronous functionality - "await" should be "listen" no? await implies that the thread blocks - 

Dev blurb:

TL;DR - I prefer nocase variable naming ( globals / constants / modules etc excepted ) 

This is my first time using Python also .. ( I have a C/Perl/PHP web/unix history )

I still prefer nocase variables like $myname ... sorry !

I blame the shells/unix: chmod , rmdir , pwd , wc ..

Cannot get used to friend_1 over friend1
